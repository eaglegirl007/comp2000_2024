Clone this repository (well done!)

# Task 1

Take a look at the two repositories:

  * (A) https://bitbucket.org/altmattr/personalised-correlation/src/master/
  * (B) https://github.com/Whiley/WhileyCompiler

And answer the following questions about them:

  * These repositories are at two different websites - github and bitbucket - what are these sites? What service do they provide? Which is better?
Both are websites that are used for hosting code. The code can be accessed and edited by many users in their own 'forks' for easier collaborative programming. It also allows programmers to access previous iterations of the code if something goes wrong.

  * Who made the last commit to repository A?
Matthew Roberts

  * Who made the first commit to repository A?
Jon Mountjoy

  * Who made the first and last commits to repository B?
DavePearce

  * Are either/both of these projects active at the moment? ðŸ¤” If not, what do you think happened?
Neither have been active recently. Maybe the creators have moved on to another project they deem more important, or they are satisfied with what has been created. They may also be waiting for others to hopefully collaborate if they are stuck on a specific problem.

  * ðŸ¤” Which file in each project has had the most activity?
A) pycache
B) LICENSE

# Task 2

The repository you just cloned is a VSCode project, so lets work with it.  It currently will print "Hello World" message to the console when run.

You will find "Run" and "Debug" commands over the `main` method.  Try them out.  You can also trigger them with `F5` for "Debug" and `Ctrl-F5` for "Run"

Modify the application so that instead it prints

~~~~~
Red vs. Blue
~~~~~

System.out.println("~~~~~\n" + "Red vs. Blue\n" + "~~~~~");
